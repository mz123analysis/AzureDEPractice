# AzureDEPractice
Practicing building a full End-to-End Pipeline from Data Source to Dashboard

We want to test Azure and its different services. Time limit for this project will be 30 days and the process.

Data will be man made. This will then be put into an undisclosed SFTP server to mimic getting our files from SFTP. From there we will save files in a local folder.

We will then schedule the creation and importation into our SQL Server hosted on Azure through Apache Airflow and eventually try it with Dagster. 

From there, we will create a simple dashboard with KPIs on PowerBI.
